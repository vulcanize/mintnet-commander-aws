The files in this directory are supposed to make profiles and providers easier, and should be placed as `/etc/salt/cloud.profiles` and `/etc/salt/cloud.providers`. They use the `extend` keyword to avoid duplication. More can be read [here](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/topics/cloud/config.html#extending-profiles-and-cloud-providers-configuration).

Does not work, maybe has been used incorrectly?
